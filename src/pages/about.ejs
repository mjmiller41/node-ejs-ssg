<p>
  I am a student at DeVry University working toward an Associates of Science in Information Technology and
  Networking. With a GPA of 3.7 I am looking forward to graduating in August of 2023.
</p>
<p>
  I am also participating in the
  <a href="https://www.pnw.edu/cybersecurity/cwct/" target="_blank"
    >Cybersecurity Workforce Certification Training</a
  >
  program, a certification based national training program for transitioning military, first responders, and
  other adult trainees. The CWCT prepares students to sit for CompTIA A+, Linux+, Security+, Red Hat Certified
  System Administrator, Cisco CyberOps Associate, and EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker and is supported by
  a National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity Grant, housed at the National Security Agency.
